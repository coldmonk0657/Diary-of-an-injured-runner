bitter sweet since the last time I wrote

started continuing to be sore

while pacing Anshita, discovered that it doesn't hurt when I'm running super slow, like 7-7:30/ km

started to run that slow for first and last km and saw some progress. did a comfortable 45 mins today. also did some strength training in the last 3 days. 2 weeks before that 0 strength training since I was travelling.

travelling next 10 days again so only ground exercises and running/ hiking. idea is to maintain 45-60 min runs. 

until next time!
