going good so far!

eating a bit of junk and weight is on higher spectrum of the target range. ordered protein powder to have before sleeping- habit that will help me curtail volume of junk during dinner- a meal that's most vulnerable to unhealthy eating.

executed well last week on all planned workouts. I could feel my left knee tightening up after the one hour run so we will stick to basics and repeat last week's routine minus maybe one workout since I'll go hiking on Friday.

esp. happy with yesterday's run where I ran with lesser ankle discomfort, faster than usual pace (still turtle pace as compared to potential) and a very controlled heart rate. 

things tend to be moving in the positive direction. just need to keep in steady and let it compound.

have a physio appointment next Wed so let's go and RCA this little nagging pain.

LFG!
