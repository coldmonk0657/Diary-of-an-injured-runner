this month has been a blur! 

getting comfortable with 45-60 mins runs with very little discomfort, kept up with 1-2x/ week strength training. weight trending in the desired category. starting to play tennis 1x/ week as well. did a comfortable 61 min 10k last weekend which is the highlight of last 3 months.

visited the physio. he said I should cotinue with sub 40 min. runs and do lower body strength 2x/ week. also need to use weights and machines in the gym to amp up training. 

started using some machines already but have a personal training session in the gym today to get acquainted with all the machines.

onto next week-
Monday- 45 mins run
Tue- lower body strength
Wed- slacklining
Thu- tennis
Fri- https://x.com/bcfridayguy/status/1793869586112065604
