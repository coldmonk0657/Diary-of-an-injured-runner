it's been bad!

recovering from a flu so activity has been low

the week before, hardcourt tennis + a longish run seems to have impacted IT band again, I feel like I'm nback to square one. I thought gym strength training was helping. Will take this week sloa and see how it pans out. Fingers crossed on this not being totally back to square one. Vamos. 

next week- 
1. 20 mins run
2. legs strength 
3. upper body and core strength
4. 40 mins run
5. 50 mins run
