Objectively, this hasn't been the worst year. I started the year coming back from an injury and did my 15K PR in feb at around 5 mins 15 secs/ km with loads of margin to do better (my brother and I ran faster just because the complex was about to close, we were running comfortably for the first 10k).

I have improved both my strength and the appetite to be regular at strength training, thanks to the Swedish winter. I have also learnt how to cook and reduced my stable state weight to a couple of kgs below my old equilibrium even when I'm not working out.

I've just been stupid 2x in April and that has cost me dearly. Also come to realize that cycling and SATS crossfit during "break" didn't quite let my IT band and upper ankle heal.

Okay so for tomorrow,
Training- 10 mins activation, 1km outdoor run, 20 mins upper body and core at the gym
Food- milk + berries for breakfast, cook dinner at home

LFG!

Oh and yes, we fully adopt the rule of "no running in pain" now.
