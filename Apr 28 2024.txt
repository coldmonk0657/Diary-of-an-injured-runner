executed well this week.. 

weighing in target range
legs session
comfortable 50 mins run
upper body and core session

next week similar routine-
40 mins easy run
lower body session
30 mins easy run
60 mins easy run
upper body and core

one thing that's bothering me soreness and a nagging pain below my left ankle. it starts 15 mins into the run and goes away few minutes post run. aim to seek physio help in the coming week. 

LFG.
