Last week did back to back Sat (40 mins) and Sun (20 mins) runs which made me feel a bit sore till Tue which is disappointing. Did the long awaited core + upper body session on Sunday.

Did a 40 mins run today- comfortable and slightly higher pace than last Saturday. That felt good.

Been eating healthy and weight has been stablising. 

Tomorrow end of the day I do a legs strength session.

Keep hammering.
