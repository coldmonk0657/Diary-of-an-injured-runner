slow few last days due to heavy work and inability to adjust to evening workout routine. 2x started to execute but couldn't follow through since felt too tired and hungry.

making two changes to the routine-
1. reverting back to morning workouts
2. not working out everyday during weekdays, too wishful. new target- Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat, Sun. on Tue and Thu we relax and cook so that we don't get overwhelmed. 

in this while, put in a couple of comfortable runs- 30 mins and 40 mins. consistency with 10 mins activation and ensuring wamrup/ cooldown within running helps maintain sanity. there's just a little discomfort around left IT band and ankle but it's slowly reducing.

tomorrow, I do activation, 30 mins upper body n core followed by 20 minutes light running. 

been eating unhealthy since two days, time to bounce back on that front!
